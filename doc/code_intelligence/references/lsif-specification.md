# Language Server Index Format

This document outlines the format of the precise code intelligence indexes ingested by a Sourcegraph instance.

This format is based off of v0.5.0 of Microsoft's [LSIF specification](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsif/0.5.0/specification/) and includes several backwards-compatible extensions (noted specifically below). Periodically, we will refresh our specification to include changes in Microsoft's specification in order to maintain the following design invariant:

_An LSIF indexer built following Microsoft's specification should be ingestible by Sourcegraph, though it may be missing data required to power certain Sourcegraph-specific features, such as generation of API documentation._

## Data model

An LSIF index encodes a directed graph of vertices connected by edges. Vertices encode objects and facts about objects within a project (such source text locations and diagnostics). Edges encode relationships between these objects (such as linking references of a symbol to its definition).

Every vertex and edge within an index have the following properties.

```typescript
type ID = string | int

export interface Element {
	ID: ID
	Type: 'vertex' | 'edge'
	Label: string
}
```

The `ID` field uniquely defines an element within an index and is used by edges to refer to its incident vertices. An element identifier can be either a string or an integer. It is not recommended to mix types within the same index. The `Type` field identifies an element as either a vertex or an edge. The `Label` field further identifies an element as a particular subtype of a vertex or an edge. Subtypes of vertices and edges may define additional fields. Thus, an element is in practice a tagged union and the value of the `Label` field determines how to interpret the element payload.

Edges can be classified into two distinct groups: single-target and multi-target edges. For an edge _x -> y_, we refer to _x_ as the `OutV` and _y_ as the `InV`. Single-target edges (1-to-1 edges) will have a single `InV` value, and multiple-target edges (1-to-n edges) will have one or more `InVs` values. Certain subtypes of 1-to-n edges may attribute meaning to the order of their `InVs` list.

```typescript
interface Edge1to1 extends Element {
  Type: 'edge'
  OutV: ID
  InV: ID
}
```

```typescript
interface Edge1toN extends Element {
  Type: 'edge'
  OutV: ID
  InVs: ID[]
}
```

Unlike edges, there are no additional fields common to all vertex types.

```typescript
interface Vertex extends Element {
  Type: 'vertex'
}
```

Specific subtypes of vertices and edges are detailed in the following.

### MetaData vertex

TODO

```typescript
interface MetaData extends Vertex {
  Type: 'metaData'
  Version: string
  ProjectRoot: string
  ToolInfo?: ToolInfo
}

interface ToolInfo {
  Name: string
  Version?: string
  Args?: string[]
}
```

<!--
	// We assume that the project root in the LSIF dump is either:
	//
	//   (1) the root of the LSIF dump, or
	//   (2) the root of the repository
	//
	// These are the common cases and we don't explicitly support
	// anything else. Here we normalize to (1) by appending the dump
	// root if it's not already suffixed by it.
-->

TODO

<!--
REFERENCE
To support versioning the LSIF defines a meta data vertex as follows:

```typescript
export interface MetaData {

  /**
   * The label property.
   */
  label: 'metaData';

  /**
   * The version of the LSIF format using semver notation. See https://semver.org/. Please note
   * the version numbers starting with 0 don't adhere to semver and adopters have to assume
   * the each new version is breaking.
   */
  version: string;

  /**
   * The project root (in form of an URI) used to compute this dump.
   */
  projectRoot: Uri;

  /**
   * The string encoding used to compute line and character values in
   * positions and ranges. Currently only 'utf-16' is support due to the
   * limitations in LSP.
   */
  positionEncoding: 'utf-16',

  /**
   * Information about the tool that created the dump
   */
  toolInfo?: {
    name: string;
    version?: string;
    args?: string[];
  }
}
```
-->

<!--
### Emitting constraints

The following emitting constraints (some of which have already mean mentioned in the document) exists:

- a vertex needs to be emitted before it can be referenced in an edge.
- a `range` and `resultRange` can only be contained in one document.
- a `resultRange` can not be used as a target in a `contains` edge.
- after a document end event has been emitted only result sets, reference or implementation results emitted through that document can be referenced in edges. It is for example not allowed to reference ranges or result ranges from that document. This also includes adding monikers to ranges or result sets. The document data so to speak can not be altered anymore.
- if ranges point to result sets and monikers are emitted, they must be emitted on the result set and can't be emitted on individual ranges.
-->

### Documents

TODO

```typescript
interface Document extends Vertex {
  Label: 'document'
  URI: string
}
```

TODO

### Ranges

TODO

```typescript
interface Range extends Vertex, RangeData {
  Label: 'range'
  Tag?: RangeTag
}

interface RangeData {
  Start: Position
  End: Position
}

interface Position {
  Line: int
  Character: int
}

interface RangeTag {
  Type: string
  Text: string
  Kind: int
  FullRange?: RangeData
  Detail: string
  Tags: int[]
}
```

TODO

<!--
For requests that take a position as its input, we need to store the position as well. Usually LSP requests return the same result for positions that point to the same word / name in a document. Take the following TypeScript example:

```typescript
function bar() {
}
```

A hover request for a position denoting the `b` in `bar` will return the same result as a position denoting the `a` or `r`. To make the dump more compact, it will use ranges to capture this instead of single positions. The following vertices will be emitted in this case. Note that line, character are zero based as in the LSP:

```typescript
{ id: 4, type: "vertex", label: "range", start: { line: 0, character: 9}, end: { line: 0, character: 12 } }
```

To bind the range to a document, we use a special edge labeled `contains` which points from a document to a set of ranges.

```typescript
{ id: 5, type: "edge", label: "contains", outV: 1, inVs: [4] }
```

LSIF supports 1:n edges for the `contains` relationship which in a graph can easily be mapped to n 1:1 edges. LSIF support this for two reasons: (a) to make the output more compact since a document usually contains hundreds of those ranges and (b) to easy the import and batching for consumers of a LSIF dump.

To bind the hover result to the range, we use the same pattern as we used for the folding ranges. We emit a vertex representing the hover result and an edge representing the `textDocument/hover` request.

```typescript
{
  id: 6,
  type: "vertex",
  label: "hoverResult",
  result: {
    contents: [
      { language: "typescript", value: "function bar(): void" }
    ]
  }
}
{ id: 7, type: "edge", label: "textDocument/hover", outV: 4, inV: 6 }
```

The corresponding graph looks like this

<img src="../img/hoverResult.png" alt="Hover Result" style="max-width: 66%; max-height: 66%"/>

The ranges emitted for a document in the contains relationship must follow these rules:

1. a given range ID can only be contained in one document or in other words: ranges must not be shared between documents even if the have the same start / end value.
1. No two ranges can be equal.
1. No two ranges can overlap, claiming the same position in a document unless one range is entirely contained by the other.

If a position in a document is mapped to a range and more than one range covers the position, the following algorithm should be used:

1. sort the ranges by containment with innermost first
1. for range in ranges do
   1. check if the range has an outgoing edge `textDocument/${method}`
   1. if yes, use it
1. end
1. return `null`
-->

### Result ranges

TODO

<!--
REFERENCE
Ranges in LSIF have currently two meanings:

1. they act as LSP request sensitive areas in a document (e.g. we use them to decided of for a given position a corresponding LSP request result exists)
1. they act as navigation targets (e.g. they are the result of a Go To declaration navigation).

To fulfil the first LSIF specifies that ranges can't overlap or be the same. However this constraint is not necessary for the second meaning. To support equal or overlapping target ranges we introduce a vertex `resultRange`. It is not allowed to use a `resultRange` as a target in a `contains` edge.
-->


### Result Set

TODO

```typescript
interface ResultSet extends Vertex {
}
```

TODO

<!--
REFERENCE
Usually the hover result is the same whether you hover over a definition of a function or over a reference of that function. The same is actually true for many LSP requests like `textDocument/definition`, `textDocument/references` or `textDocument/typeDefinition`. In a naÃ¯ve model, each range would have outgoing edges for all these LSP requests and would point to the corresponding results. To optimize this and to make the graph easier to understand, the concept of a `ResultSet` is introduced. A result set acts as a hub to be able to store information common to a lot of ranges. The `ResultSet` itself doesn't carry any information. So it looks like this:

```typescript
export interface ResultSet {
}
```

The corresponding output of the above example with a hover using a result set looks like this:

```typescript
{ id: 1, type: "vertex", label: "document", uri: "file:///Users/dirkb/sample.ts", languageId: "typescript" }
{ id: 2, type: "vertex", label: "resultSet" }
{ id: 3, type: "vertex", label: "range", start: { line: 0, character: 9}, end: { line: 0, character: 12 } }
{ id: 4, type: "edge", label: "contains", outV: 1, inVs: [3] }
{ id: 5, type: "edge", label: "next", outV: 3, inV: 2 }
{ id: 6, type: "vertex", label: "hoverResult", result: {"contents":[{"language":"typescript","value":"function bar(): void"},""] }
{ id: 7, type: "edge", label: "textDocument/hover", outV: 2, inV: 6 }
```

<img src="../img/resultSet.png" alt="Result Set"  style="max-width: 50%; max-height: 50%"/>

Result sets are linked to ranges using a `next` edge. A results set can also forward information to another result set by linking to it using a `next` edge.

The pattern of storing the result with the `ResultSet` will be used for other requests as well. The lookup algorithm is therefore as follows for a request [document, position, method]:

1. find all ranges for [document, position]. If none exist, return `null` as the result
1. sort the ranges by containment the innermost first
1. for range in ranges do
   1. assign range to out
   1. while out !== `null`
      1. check if out has an outgoing edge `textDocument/${method}`. if yes, use it and return the corresponding result
      1. check if out has an outgoing `next` edge. If yes, set out to the target vertex. Else set out to `null`
   1. end
1. end
1. otherwise return `null`
-->

<!--
### The Project vertex

Usually language servers operate in some sort of project context. In TypeScript, a project is defined using a `tsconfig.json` file. C# and C++ have their own means. The project file usually contains information about compile options and other parameters. Having these in the dump can be valuable. The LSIF therefore defines a project vertex. In addition, all documents that belong to that project are connected to the project using a `contains` edge. If there was a `tsconfig.json` in the previous examples, the first emitted edges and vertices would look like this:

```typescript
{ id: 1, type: "vertex", label: "project", resource: "file:///Users/dirkb/tsconfig.json", kind: "typescript"}
{ id: 2, type: "vertex", label: "document", uri: "file:///Users/dirkb/sample.ts", languageId: "typescript" }
{ id: 3, type: "edge", label: "contains", outV: 1, inVs: [2] }
```

The definition of the `project` vertex looks as follows:

```ts
export interface Project extends V {

	/**
	 * The label property.
	 */
	label: VertexLabels.project;

	/**
	 * The project kind like 'typescript' or 'csharp'. See also the language ids
	 * in the [specification](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification)
	 */
	kind: string;

	/**
	 * The resource URI of the project file.
	 */
	resource?: Uri;

	/**
	 * Optional the content of the project file, `base64` encoded.
	 */
	contents?: string;
}
```

### Monikers

```typescript
interface Moniker extends Vertex {
  Type: 'moniker'
  Kind: string
  Scheme: string
  Identifier: string
}
```

TODO

```typescript
interface PackageInformation extends Vertex {
  Type: 'packageInformation'
  Name: string
  Version: string
}
```

TODO

<!--
REFERENCE
One use case of the LSIF is to create dumps for released versions of a product, either a library or a program. If a project **A** references a library **B**, it would also be useful if the information in these two dumps could be related. To make this possible, the LSIF introduces optional monikers which can be linked to ranges using a corresponding edge. The monikers can be used to describe what a project exports and what it imports. Let's first look at the export case.

Consider the following TypeScript file called `index.ts`:

```typescript
export function func(): void {
}

export class Emitter {
  private doEmit() {
  }

  public emit() {
    this.doEmit();
  }
}
```

```typescript
{ id: 4, type: "vertex", label: "document", uri: "file:///Users/dirkb/index.ts", languageId: "typescript", contents: "..." }
{ id: 11, type: "vertex", label: "resultSet" }
{ id: 12, type: "vertex", label: "moniker", kind: "export", scheme: "tsc", identifier: "lib/index:func" }
{ id: 13, type: "edge", label: "moniker", outV: 11, inV: 12 }
{ id: 14, type: "vertex", label: "range", start: { line: 0, character: 16 }, end: { line: 0, character: 20 } }
{ id: 15, type: "edge", label: "next", outV: 14, inV: 11 }

{ id: 18, type: "vertex", label: "resultSet" }
{ id: 19, type: "vertex", label: "moniker", kind: "export", scheme: "tsc", identifier: "lib/index:Emitter" }
{ id: 20, type: "edge", label: "moniker", outV: 18, inV: 19 }
{ id: 21, type: "vertex", label: "range", start: { line: 3, character: 13 }, end: { line: 3, character: 20 } }
{ id: 22, type: "edge", label: "next", outV: 21, inV: 18 }

{ id: 25, type: "vertex", label: "resultSet" }
{ id: 26, type: "vertex", label: "moniker", kind: "export", scheme: "tsc", identifier: "lib/index:Emitter.doEmit" }
{ id: 27, type: "edge", label: "moniker", outV: 25, inV: 26 }
{ id: 28, type: "vertex", label: "range", start: { line: 4, character: 10 }, end: { line: 4, character: 16 } }
{ id: 29, type: "edge", label: "next", outV: 28, inV: 25 }

{ id: 32, type: "vertex", label: "resultSet" }
{ id: 33, type: "vertex", label: "moniker", kind: "export", scheme: "tsc", identifier: "lib/index:Emitter.emit" }
{ id: 34, type: "edge", label: "moniker", outV: 32, inV: 33 }
{ id: 35, type: "vertex", label: "range", start: { line: 7, character: 9 }, end: { line: 7, character: 13 } }
{ id: 36, type: "edge", label: "next", outV: 35, inV: 32 }
```

This describes the exported declaration inside `index.ts` with a moniker (e.g. a handle in string format) that is bound to the corresponding range declaration. The generated moniker must be position independent and stable so that it can be used to identify the symbol in other projects or documents. It should be sufficiently unique so as to avoid matching other monikers in other projects unless they actually refer to the same symbol. A moniker therefore has two properties: a `scheme` to indicate how the `identifiers` is to be interpreted. And the `identifier` to actually identify the symbol. It structure is opaque to the scheme owner. In the above example the monikers are created by the TypeScript compiler tsc and can only be compared to monikers also having the scheme `tsc`.

Please also note that the method `Emitter#doEmit` has a moniker although the method is private. If private elements do have monikers depend on the programming language. Since TypeScript cant enforce visibility (it compiles to JS which doesn't have the concept) we treat them as visible. Even the TypeScript language server does so. Find all references does find all references to private methods even if it is flagged as a visibility violation.

How these exported elements are visible in other projects in most programming languages depends on how many files are packaged into a library or program. In TypeScript, the standard package manager is npm.

Consider that the following `package.json` file exists:

```json
{
  "name": "lsif-ts-sample",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "lib/index.js",
  "author": "MS",
  "license": "MIT",
}
```

then these monikers can be translated into monikers that are `npm` dependent. Instead of replacing the monikers we emit a second set of monikers and link the `tsc` monikers to corresponding `npm` monikers using a `nextMoniker`edge:

```typescript
{ id: 991, type: "vertex", label: "packageInformation", name: "lsif-ts-sample", manager: "npm", version: "1.0.0" }

{ id: 987, type: "vertex", label: "moniker", kind: "export", scheme: "npm", identifier: "lsif-ts-sample::func" }
{ id: 986, type: "edge", label: "packageInformation", outV: 987, inV: 991 }
{ id: 985, type: "edge", label: "nextMoniker", outV: 12, inV: 987 }

{ id: 984, type: "vertex", label: "moniker", kind: "export", scheme: "npm", identifier: "lsif-ts-sample::Emitter" }
{ id: 983, type: "edge", label: "packageInformation", outV: 984, inV: 991 }
{ id: 982, type: "edge", label: "nextMoniker", outV: 19, inV: 984 }

{ id: 981, type: "vertex", label: "moniker", kind: "export", scheme: "npm", identifier: "lsif-ts-sample::Emitter.doEmit" }
{ id: 980, type: "edge", label: "packageInformation", outV: 981, inV: 991 }
{ id: 979, type: "edge", label: "nextMoniker", outV: 26, inV: 981 }

{id: 978, type: "vertex", label: "moniker", kind: "export", scheme: "npm", identifier: "lsif-ts-sample::Emitter.emit" }
{id: 977, type: "edge", label: "packageInformation", outV: 978, inV: 991 }
{id: 976, type: "edge", label: "nextMoniker", outV: 33, inV: 978 }
```
Things to observe:

- a special `packageInformation`vertex got emitted to point to the corresponding npm package information.
- the npm moniker refer to the package name.
- since the file `index.ts` is the npm main file the moniker identifier as no file path. The is comparable to importing this module into TypeScript or JavaScript were only the module name and no file path is used (e.g. `import * as lsif from 'lsif-ts-sample'`).
- the `nextMoniker` edge points from the tsc moniker vertex to the npm moniker vertex.

For LSIF we recommend that a second tool is used to make the monikers emitted by the indexer be package manager dependent. This supports the use of different package managers and allows incorporating custom build tools. In the TypeScript implementation, this is done by a npm specific tool which rewrites the monikers taking the npm package information into account.

Reporting importing external symbols is done using the same approach. The LSIF emits monikers of kind `import`. Consider the following typescript example:

```typescript
import * as mobx from 'mobx';

let map: mobx.ObservableMap = new mobx.ObservableMap();
```

where `mobx` is the [npm mobx package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mobx). Running the tsc index tools produces:

```typescript
{ id: 41, type: "vertex", label: "document", uri: "file:///Users/dirkb/samples/node_modules/mobx/lib/types/observablemap.d.ts", languageId: "typescript", contents: "..." }
{ id: 55, type: "vertex", label: "resultSet" }
{ id: 57, type: "vertex", label: "moniker",  kind: "import", scheme: "tsc", identifier: "node_modules/mobx/lib/mobx:ObservableMap" }
{ id: 58, type: "edge", label: "moniker", outV: 55, inV: 57 }
{ id: 59, type: "vertex", label: "range", start: { line: 17, character: 538 }, end: { line: 17, character: 551 } }
{ id: 60, type: "edge", label: "next", outV: 59, inV: 55 }
```

Three things to note here: First, TypeScript uses declarations files for externally imported symbols. That has the nice effect that the moniker information can be attached to the declaration ranges in these files. In other languages, the information might be attached to the file actually referencing the symbol. Or a virtual document for the referenced item is generated. Second, the tool only generates this information for symbols actually referenced, not for all available symbols. Third these monikers are `tsc` specific and point to the `node_modules` folder.

However piping this information through the npm tool will generate the following information:

```typescript
{id: 991, type: "vertex", label: "packageInformation", name: "mobx", manager: "npm", version: "5.6.0", repository: { type: "git", url: "git+https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx.git" } }
{ id: 978, type: "vertex", label: "moniker", kind: "import", scheme: "npm", identifier: "mobx::ObservableMap" }
{ id: 977, type: "edge", label: "packageInformation", outV: 978, inV: 991 }
{ id: 976, type: "edge", label: "nextMoniker", outV: 978, inV: 57 }
```

which made the moniker specific to the npm `mobx` package. In addition information about the `mobx` package itself got emitted. Please note that since this is an import moniker the `nextMoniker` edge points from the `npm` moniker to the `tsc` moniker.

Usually monikers are attached to result sets since they are the same for all ranges pointing to the result set. However for dumps that don't use result sets, monikers can also be emitted on ranges.

For tools processing the dump and importing it into a database it is sometime useful to know whether a result is local to a file or not (for example function arguments can only be navigated inside the file). To help postprocessing tools to decide this LSIF generation tools should generate a moniker for locals as well. The corresponding kind to use is `local`. The identifier should still be unique inside the document.

For the following example

```ts
function foo(x: number): void {
}
```

The moniker for `x` looks like this:

```ts
{ id: 13, type: "vertex", label: "resultSet" }
{ id: 14, type: "vertex", label: "moniker", kind: "local", scheme: "tsc", identifier: "SfeOP6s53Y2HAkcViolxYA==" }
{ id: 15, type: "edge", label: "moniker", outV: 13, inV: 14 }
{ id: 16, type: "vertex", label: "range", start: { line: 0, character: 13 }, end: { line: 0, character: 14 }, tag: { type: "definition", text: "x", kind: 7, fullRange: { start: { line: 0, character: 13 }, end: { line: 0, character: 22 } } } }
{ id: 17, type: "edge", label: "next", outV: 16, inV: 13 }
```

In addition to this moniker schemes starting with `$` are reserved and shouldn't be used by a LSIF tool.

### Language Features

TODO

#### Hover text

TODO

```typescript
interface HoverResult extends Vertex {
  Label: 'hoverResult'
  Result: HoverContents
}

interface HoverContents {
  Contents: HoverPar[]
}

type HoverPart =
  | { Value: string, Language: string }
  | { Value: string, Kind: string }
  | string
```

TODO

<!--
REFERENCE
In the LSP, the hover is defined as follows:

```typescript
export interface Hover {
  /**
   * The hover's content
   */
  contents: MarkupContent | MarkedString | MarkedString[];

  /**
   * An optional range
   */
  range?: Range;
}
```

where the optional range is the name range of the word hovered over.

> **Side Note**: This is a pattern used for other LSP requests as well, where the result contains the word range of the word the position parameter pointed to.

This makes the hover different for every location so we can't really store it with the result set. But wait, the range is the range of one of the `bar` references we already emitted and used to start to compute the result. To make the hover still reusable, we ask the index server to fill in the starting range if no range is defined in the result. So for a hover request executed on range `{ line: 4, character: 2 }, end: { line: 4, character: 5 }` the hover result will be:

```typescript
{ id: 6, type: "vertex", label: "hoverResult", result: { contents: [ { language: "typescript", value: "function bar(): void" } ], range: { line: 4, character: 2 }, end: { line: 4, character: 5 } } }
```
-->

#### Definitions

TODO

<!--
REFERENCE
The same pattern of connecting a range, result set, or a document with a request edge to a method result is used for other requests as well. Let's next look at the `textDocument/definition` request using the following TypeScript sample:

```typescript
function bar() {
}

function foo() {
  bar();
}
```

This will emit the following vertices and edges to model the `textDocument/definition` request:

```typescript
// The document
{ id: 4, type: "vertex", label: "document", uri: "file:///Users/dirkb/sample.ts", languageId: "typescript" }

// The bar declaration
{ id: 6, type: "vertex", label: "resultSet" }
{ id: 9, type: "vertex", label: "range", start: { line: 0, character: 9 }, end: { line: 0, character: 12 } }
{ id: 10, type: "edge", label: "next", outV: 9, inV: 6 }


// The bar reference
{ id: 20, type: "vertex", label: "range", start: { line: 4, character: 2 }, end: { line: 4, character: 5 } }
{ id: 21, type: "edge", label: "next", outV: 20, inV: 6}

// The definition result linked to the bar result set
{ id: 22, type: "vertex", label: "definitionResult" }
{ id: 23, type: "edge", label: "textDocument/definition", outV: 6, inV: 22 }
{ id: 24, type: "edge", label: "item", outV: 22, inVs: [9], document: 4 }
```

<img src="../img/definitionResult.png" alt="Definition Result" style="max-width: 50%; max-height: 50%"/>

The definition result above has only one value (the range with id '9') and we could have emitted it directly. However, we introduced the definition result vertex for two reasons:

- To have consistency with all other requests that point to a result.
- To have support for languages where a definition can be spread over multiple ranges or even multiple documents. To support multiple documents ranges are added to a definition result using an 1:N `item` edge. Conceptionally a definition result is an array to which the `item` edge adds items.

Consider the following TypeScript example:

```typescript
interface X {
  foo();
}
interface X {
  bar();
}
let x: X;
```

Running **Go to Definition** on `X` in `let x: X` will show a dialog which lets the user select between the two definitions of the `interface X`. The emitted JSON in this case looks like this:

```typescript
{ id : 38, type: "vertex", label: "definitionResult" }
{ id : 40, type: "edge", label: "item", outV: 38, inVs: [9, 13], document: 4 }
```

The `item` edge as an additional property document which indicate in which document these declaration are. We added this information to still make it easy to emit the data but also make it easy to process the data to store it in a database. Without that information we would either need to specific an order in which data needs to be emitted (e.g. a item edge and only refer to a range that got already added to a document using a `containes` edge) or we force processing tools to keep a lot of vertices and edges in memory. The approach of having this `document` property looks like a fair balance.

<!--
### Request: `textDocument/declaration`

There are programming languages that have the concept of declarations and definitions (like C/C++). If this is the case, the dump can contain a corresponding `declarationResult` vertex and a `textDocument/declaration` edge to store the information. They are handled analogously to the entities emitted for the `textDocument/definition` request.
-->

#### References

TODO

<!--
REFERENCE
Storing references will be done in the same way as storing a hover or go to definition ranges. It uses a reference result vertex and `item` edges to add ranges to the result.

Look at the following example:

```typescript
function bar() {
}

function foo() {
  bar();
}
```

The relevant JSON output looks like this:

```typescript
// The document
{ id: 4, type: "vertex", label: "document", uri: "file:///Users/dirkb/sample.ts", languageId: "typescript" }

// The bar declaration
{ id: 6, type: "vertex", label: "resultSet" }
{ id: 9, type: "vertex", label: "range", start: { line: 0, character: 9 }, end: { line: 0, character: 12 } }
{ id: 10, type: "edge", label: "next", outV: 9, inV: 6 }

// The bar reference range
{ id: 20, type: "vertex", label: "range", start: { line: 4, character: 2 }, end: { line: 4, character: 5 } }
{ id: 21, type: "edge", label: "next", outV: 20, inV: 6 }

// The reference result
{ id : 25, type: "vertex", label: "referenceResult" }
// Link it to the result set
{ id : 26, type: "edge", label: "textDocument/references",  outV: 6, inV: 25 }

// Add the bar definition as a reference to the reference result
{ id: 27, type: "edge", label: "item", outV: 25, inVs: [9], document: 4, property : "definitions" }

// Add the bar reference as a reference to the reference result
{ id: 28, type: "edge", label: "item", outV: 25, inVs: [20], document:4, property: "references" }
```

<img src="../img/referenceResult.png" alt="References Result"  style="max-width: 50%; max-height: 50%"/>

We tag the `item` edge with id 27 as a definition since the reference result distinguishes between definitions, declarations, and references. This is done since the `textDocument/references` request takes an additional input parameter `includeDeclarations` controlling whether declarations and definitions are included in the result as well. Having three distinct properties allows the server to compute the result accordingly.

The item edge also support linking reference results to other reference results. This is useful when computing references to methods overridden in a type hierarchy.

Take the following example:

```typescript
interface I {
  foo(): void;
}

class A implements I {
  foo(): void {
  }
}

class B implements I {
  foo(): void {
  }
}

let i: I;
i.foo();

let b: B;
b.foo();
```

The reference result for the method `foo` in TypeScript contains all three declarations and both references. While parsing the document, one reference result is created and then shared between all result sets.

The output looks like this:

```typescript
// The document
{ id: 4, type: "vertex", label: "document", uri: "file:///Users/dirkb/sample.ts", languageId: "typescript" }

// The declaration of I#foo
{ id: 13, type: "vertex", label: "resultSet" }
{ id: 16, type: "vertex", label: "range", start: { line: 1, character: 2 }, end: { line: 1, character: 5 } }
{ id: 17, type: "edge", label: "next", outV: 16, inV: 13 }
// The reference result for I#foo
{ id: 30, type: "vertex", label: "referenceResult" }
{ id: 31, type: "edge", label: "textDocument/references", outV: 13, inV: 30 }

// The declaration of A#foo
{ id: 29, type: "vertex", label: "resultSet" }
{ id: 34, type: "vertex", label: "range", start: { line: 5, character: 2 }, end: { line: 5, character: 5 } }
{ id: 35, type: "edge", label: "next", outV: 34, inV: 29 }

// The declaration of B#foo
{ id: 47, type: "vertex", label: "resultSet" }
{ id: 50, type: "vertex", label: "range", start: { line: 10, character: 2 }, end: { line: 10, character: 5 } }
{ id: 51, type: "edge", label: "next", outV: 50, inV: 47 }

// The reference i.foo()
{ id: 65, type: "vertex", label: "range", start: { line: 15, character: 2 }, end: { line: 15, character: 5 } }

// The reference b.foo()
{ id: 78, type: "vertex", label: "range", start: { line: 18, character: 2 }, end: { line: 18, character: 5 } }

// The insertion of the ranges into the shared reference result
{ id: 90, type: "edge", label: "item", outV: 30, inVs: [16,34,50], document: 4, property: definitions }
{ id: 91, type: "edge", label: "item", outV: 30, inVs: [65,78], document: 4, property: references }

// Linking A#foo to I#foo
{ id: 101, type: "vertex", label: "referenceResult" }
{ id: 102, type: "edge", label: "textDocument/references", outV: 29, inV: 101 }
{ id: 103, type: "edge", label: "item", outV: 101, inVs: [30], document: 4, property: referenceResults }

// Linking B#foo to I#foo
{ id: 114, type: "vertex", label: "referenceResult" }
{ id: 115, type: "edge", label: "textDocument/references", outV: 47, inV: 114 }
{ id: 116, type: "edge", label: "item", outV: 114, inVs: [30], document: 4, property: referenceResults }
```

One goal of the language server index format is that the information can be emitted as soon as possible without caching too much information in memory. With languages that support overriding methods defined in more than one interface, this can be more complicated since the whole inheritance tree might only be known after parsing all documents.

Take the following TypeScript example:

```typescript
interface I {
  foo(): void;
}

interface II {
  foo(): void;
}

class B implements I, II {
  foo(): void {
  }
}

let i: I;
i.foo();

let b: B;
b.foo();
```

Searching for `I#foo()` finds 4 references, searching for `II#foo()` finds 3 reference, and searching on `B#foo()` finds 5 results. The interesting part here is when the declaration of `class B` gets processed which implements `I` and `II`, neither the reference result bound to `I#foo()` nor the one bound to `II#foo()` can be reused. So we need to create a new one. To still be able to profit from the results generated for `I#foo` and `II#foo`, the LSIF supports nested references results. This way the one referenced from `B#foo` will reuse the one from `I#foo` and `II#foo`. Depending on how these declarations are parsed, the two reference results might contain the same references. When a language server interprets reference results consisting of other reference results, the server is responsible to de-dup the final ranges.

In the above example, there will be three reference results

```typescript
// The document
{ id: 4, type: "vertex", label: "document", uri: "file:///Users/dirkb/sample.ts", languageId: "typescript" }

// Declaration of I#foo
{ id: 13, type: "vertex", label: "resultSet" }
{ id: 16, type: "vertex", label: "range", start: { line: 1, character: 2 }, end: { line: 1, character: 5 } }
{ id: 17, type: "edge", label: "next", outV: 16, inV: 13 }

// Declaration of II#foo
{ id: 27, type: "vertex", label: "resultSet" }
{ id: 30, type: "vertex", label: "range", start: { line: 5, character: 2 }, end: { line: 5, character: 5 } }
{ id: 31, type: "edge", label: "next", outV: 30, inV: 27 }

// Declaration of B#foo
{ id: 45, type: "vertex", label: "resultSet" }
{ id: 52, type: "vertex", label: "range", start: { line: 9, character: 2 }, end: { line: 9, character: 5 } }
{ id: 53, type: "edge", label: "next", outV: 52, inV: 45 }

// Reference result for I#foo
{ id: 46, type: "vertex", label: "referenceResult" }
{ id: 47, type: "edge", label: "textDocument/references", outV: 13, inV: 46 }

// Reference result for II#foo
{ id: 48, type: "vertex", label: "referenceResult" }
{ id: 49, type: "edge", label: "textDocument/references", outV: 27, inV: 48 }

// Reference result for B#foo
{ id: 116 "typ" :"vertex", label: "referenceResult" }
{ id: 117 "typ" :"edge", label: "textDocument/references", outV: 45, inV: 116 }

// Link B#foo reference result to I#foo and II#foo
{ id: 118 "typ" :"edge", label: "item", outV: 116, inVs: [46,48], document: 4, property: "referenceResults" }
```

For Typescript, method references are recorded at their most abstract declaration and if methods are merged (`B#foo`), they are combined using a reference result pointing to other results.
-->

<!--
### Request: `textDocument/implementation`

Supporting a `textDocument/implementation` request is done reusing what we implemented for a `textDocument/references` request. In most cases, the `textDocument/implementation` returns the declaration values of the reference result that a symbol declaration points to. For cases where the result differs, the LSIF provides an `ImplementationResult`. To nest implementation results the `item` edge supports a `property` value `"implementationResults"`.

The corresponding `ImplementationResult` looks like this:

```typescript
interface ImplementationResult {

  label: `implementationResult`
}
```

### Request: `textDocument/typeDefinition`

Supporting `textDocument/typeDefinition` is straightforward. The edge is either recorded at the range or at the `ResultSet`.

The corresponding `TypeDefinitionResult` looks like this:

```typescript
interface TypeDefinitionResult {

  label: `typeDefinitionResult`
}
```

For the following TypeScript example:

```typescript
interface I {
  foo(): void;
}

let i: I;
```

The relevant emitted vertices and edges looks like this:

```typescript
// The document
{ id: 4, type: "vertex", label: "document", uri: "file:///Users/dirkb/sample.ts", languageId: "typescript" }

// The declaration of I
{ id: 6, type: "vertex", label: "resultSet" }
{ id: 9, type: "vertex", label: "range", start: { line: 0, character: 10 }, end: { line: 0, character: 11 } }
{ id: 10, type: "edge", label: "next", outV: 9, inV: 6 }

// The declaration of i
{ id: 26, type: "vertex", label: "resultSet" }
// The type definition result
{ id: 37, type: "vertex", label: "typeDefinitionResult" }
// Hook the result to the declaration
{ id: 38, type: "edge", label: "textDocument/typeDefinition", outV: 26, inV:37 }
// Add the declaration of I as a target range.
{ id: 51, type: "edge", label: "item", outV: 37, inVs: [9], document: 4 }
```

As with other results ranges get added using a `item` edge. In this case without a `property` since there is only on kind of range.
-->

<!--
## Document requests

The Language Server Protocol also supports requests for documents only (without any position information). These requests are `textDocument/foldingRange`, `textDocument/documentLink`, and `textDocument/documentSymbol`. We follow the same pattern as before to model these, the difference being that the result is linked to the document instead of to a range.

### Request: `textDocument/foldingRange`

For the folding range result this looks like this:

```typescript
function hello() {
  console.log('Hello');
}

function world() {
  console.log('world');
}

function space() {
  console.log(' ');
}
hello();space();world();
```

```typescript
{ id: 2, type: "vertex", label: "document", uri: "file:///Users/dirkb/sample.ts", languageId: "typescript" }
{ id: 112, type: "vertex", label: "foldingRangeResult", result:[
  { startLine: 0, startCharacter: 16, endLine: 2, endCharacter: 1 },
  { startLine: 4, startCharacter: 16, endLine: 6, endCharacter: 1 },
  { startLine: 8, startCharacter: 16, endLine: 10, endCharacter: 1 }
]}
{ id: 113, type: "edge", label: "textDocument/foldingRange", outV: 2, inV: 112 }
```

The corresponding `FoldingRangeResult` is defined as follows:

```typescript
export interface FoldingRangeResult {
  label: 'foldingRangeResult';

  result: lsp.FoldingRange[];
}
```

### Request: `textDocument/documentLink`

Again, for document links, we define a result type and a corresponding edge to link it to a document. Since the link location usually appear in comments, the ranges don't denote any symbol declarations or references. We therefore inline the range into the result like we do with folding ranges.

```typescript
export interface DocumentLinkResult {
  label: 'documentLinkResult';

  result: lsp.DocumentLink[];
}
```

### Request: `textDocument/documentSymbol`

Next we look at the `textDocument/documentSymbol` request. This request usually returns an outline view of the document in hierarchical form. However, not all programming symbols declared or defined in a document are part of the result (for example, locals are usually omitted). In addition, an outline item needs to provide additional information like the full range and a symbol kind. There are two ways we can model this: either we do the same as we do for folding ranges and the document links and store the information in a document symbol result as literals, or we extend the range vertex with some additional information and refer to these ranges in the document symbol result. Since the additional information for ranges might be helpful in other scenarios as well, we support adding additional tags to these ranges  by defining a `tag` property on the `range` vertex.

The following tags are currently supported:

```typescript
/**
 * The range represents a declaration
 */
export interface DeclarationTag {

  /**
   * A type identifier for the declaration tag.
   */
  type: 'declaration';

  /**
   * The text covered by the range
   */
  text: string;

  /**
   * The kind of the declaration.
   */
  kind: lsp.SymbolKind;

  /**
   * The full range of the declaration not including leading/trailing whitespace but everything else, e.g comments and code.
   * The range must be included in fullRange.
   */
  fullRange: lsp.Range;

  /**
   * Optional detail information for the declaration.
   */
  detail?: string;
}

/**
 * The range respresents a definition
 */
export interface DefinitionTag {
  /**
   * A type identifier for the declaration tag.
   */
  type: 'definition';

  /**
   * The text covered by the range
   */
  text: string;

  /**
   * The symbol kind.
   */
  kind: lsp.SymbolKind;

  /**
   * The full range of the definition not including leading/trailing whitespace but everything else, e.g comments and code.
   * The range must be included in fullRange.
   */
  fullRange: lsp.Range;

  /**
   * Optional detail information for the definition.
   */
  detail?: string;
}

/**
 * The range represents a reference
 */
export interface ReferenceTag {

  /**
   * A type identifier for the reference tag.
   */
  type: 'reference';

  /**
   * The text covered by the range
   */
  text: string;
}

/**
 * The type of the range is unknown.
 */
export interface UnknownTag {

  /**
   * A type identifier for the unknown tag.
   */
  type: 'unknown';

  /**
   * The text covered by the range
   */
  text: string;
}
```

Emitting the tags for the following TypeScript example:

```typescript
function hello() {
}

hello();
```

Will look like this:

```typescript
{ id: 2, type: "vertex", label: "document", uri: "file:///Users/dirkb/sample.ts", languageId: "typescript" }
{ id: 4, type: "vertex", label: "resultSet" }
{ id: 7, type: "vertex", label: "range",
  start: { line: 0, character: 9 }, end: { line: 0, character: 14 },
  tag: { type: "definition", text: "hello", kind: 12, fullRange: { start: { line: 0, character: 0 }, end: { line: 1, character: 1 }}}
}
```

The document symbol result is then modeled as follows:

```typescript
export interface RangeBasedDocumentSymbol {

  id: RangeId

  children?: RangeBasedDocumentSymbol[];
}

export interface DocumentSymbolResult extends V {

  label: 'documentSymbolResult';

  result: lsp.DocumentSymbol[] | RangeBasedDocumentSymbol[];
}
```

The given TypeScript example:

```typescript
namespace Main {
  function hello() {
  }
  function world() {
    let i: number = 10;
  }
}
```

Produces the following output:

```typescript
// The document
{ id: 2 , type: "vertex", label: "document", uri: "file:///Users/dirkb/sample.ts", languageId: "typescript" }
// The declaration of Main
{ id: 7 , type: "vertex", label: "range", start: { line: 0, character: 10 }, end: { line: 0, character: 14 }, tag: { type: "definition", text: "Main", kind: 7, fullRange: { start: { line: 0, character: 0 }, end: { line: 5, character: 1 } } } }
// The declaration of hello
{ id: 18 , type: "vertex", label: "range", start: { line: 1, character: 11 }, end: { line: 1, character: 16 }, tag: { type: "definition", text: "hello", kind: 12, fullRange: { start: { line: 1, character: 2 }, end: { line: 2, character: 3 } } } }
// The declaration of world
{ id: 29 , type: "vertex", label: "range", start: { line: 3, character: 11 }, end: { line: 3, character: 16 }, tag: { type: "definition", text: "world", kind: 12, fullRange: { start: { line: 3, character: 2 }, end: { line: 4, character: 3 } } } }
// The document symbol
{ id: 39 , type: "vertex", label: "documentSymbolResult", result: [ { id: 7 , children: [ { id: 18 }, { id: 29 } ] } ] }
{ id: 40 , type: "edge", label: "textDocument/documentSymbol", outV: 2, inV: 39 }
```
-->

#### Diagnostics

TODO

```typescript
interface Diagnostic extends Vertex {
  Type: 'diagnosticResult'
  Severity: int
  Code: string
  Message: string
  Source: string
  Range: RangeData
}
```

TODO

<!--
REFERENCE
The only information missing that is useful in a dump are the diagnostics associated with documents. Diagnostics in the LSP are modeled as a push notifications sent from the server to the client. This doesn't work well with a dump modeled on request method names. However, the push notification can be emulated as a request where the request's result is the value sent during the push as a parameter.

In the dump, we model diagnostics as follows:

- We introduce a pseudo request `textDocument/diagnostic`.
- We introduce a diagnostic result which contains the diagnostics associated with a document.

The result looks like this:

```typescript
export interface DiagnosticResult {

  label: 'diagnosticResult';

  result: lsp.Diagnostic[];
}
```

The given TypeScript example:

```typescript
function foo() {
  let x: string = 10;
}
```

Produces the following output:

```typescript
{ id: 2, type: "vertex", label: "document", uri: "file:///Users/dirkb/sample.ts", languageId: "typescript" }
{ id: 18, type: "vertex", label: "diagnosticResult", result: [{ severity: 1, code: 2322, message: "Type '10' is not assignable to type 'string'.", range: { start : { line: 1, character: 5 }, end: { line: 1, character: 6 } } } ] }
{ id: 19, type: "edge", label: "textDocument/diagnostic", outV: 2, inV: 18 }
```

Since diagnostics are not very common in dumps, no effort has been made to reuse ranges in diagnostics.
-->

<!--
### Events

To ease the processing of an LSIF dump to for example import it into a database the dump emits begin and end events for documents and projects. After the end event of a document has been emitted the dump must not contain any further data referencing that document. For example no ranges from that document can be referenced in `item` edges. Nor can result sets or other vertices linked to the ranges in that document. The document can however be reference in a `contains` edge adding the document to a project. The begin / end events for documents look like this:

```ts
// The actual document
{ id: 4, type: "vertex", label: "document", uri: "file:///Users/dirkb/sample.ts", languageId: "typescript", contents: "..." }
// The begin event
{ id: 5, type: "vertex", label: "$event", kind: "begin", scope: "document" , data: 4 }
// The end event
{ id: 53, type: "vertex", label: "$event", kind: "end", scope: "document" , data: 4 }
```

Between the document vertex `4` and the document begin event `5` no information specific to document `4` can be emitted. Please note that more than one document can be open at a given point in time meaning that there have been n different document begin events without corresponding document end events.

The events for projects looks similar:

```ts
{ id: 2, type: "vertex", label: "project", kind: "typescript" }
{ id: 4, type: "vertex", label: "document", uri: "file:///Users/dirkb/sample.ts", languageId: "typescript", contents: "..." }
{ id: 5, type: "vertex", label: "$event", kind: "begin", scope: "document" , data: 4 }
{ id: 3, type: "vertex", label: "$event", kind: "begin", scope: "project", data: 2 }
{ id: 53, type: "vertex", label: "$event", kind: "end", scope: "document", data: 4 }
{ id: 54, type: "edge", label: "contains", outV: 2, inVs: [4] }
{ id: 55, type: "vertex", label: "$event", kind: "end", scope: "project", data: 2 }
```
